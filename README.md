# Mulino file show

A lightweight WordPress plugin for browsing documents (or any files) in
nested folders — think decades and years, or any hierarchy you like —
with drag-and-drop upload and organization in the admin, and a clean,
breadcrumb-navigable folder browser on the public side of your site.

[![Tests](https://github.com/pedroviking/mulino-file-show/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pedroviking/mulino-file-show/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

## Why

Built for a homeowners association site that needed a simple way to
publish 20+ years of meeting minutes and documents, organized by year,
without relying on an unmaintained plugin that didn't support current
PHP versions.

## Features

- **Nested folders** (e.g. Decade → Year), not just a flat list
- **Drag-and-drop admin screen** — drop files or whole folders from
  your computer straight into a folder, drag existing documents or
  whole folders to re-file them, or tick several documents to move or
  trash them together
- **Rename and delete** folders and documents from the same screen
- **Export as ZIP** with the folder structure intact, so you're never locked in
- **Import from Simple File List**, which was closed on WordPress.org in July 2026
- **Frontend browser** via a simple shortcode, with breadcrumb
  navigation and file-type icons (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- No custom database tables — built entirely on WordPress' own post
  types and taxonomies, so your data stays portable and inspectable
- A handful of actions/filters for building your own add-ons — see
  [`HOOKS.md`](HOOKS.md)

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.9+
- PHP 7.4+

## Installation

Mulino file show is available in the WordPress.org plugin directory:
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/mulino-file-show/>

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New** and search for
   "Mulino file show".
2. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.

## Usage

- Manage folders and documents under **File Show** in the admin menu.
- Drop a file onto the drop zone to upload it into the currently open
  folder; drag a file card or a folder in the tree to re-file it.
- Add the `[mulino_documents]` shortcode to any page or post to
  show the public, browsable folder view.
- Optional shortcode attributes: `folder="slug"` (start in one folder),
  `folder_order="desc"` (e.g. newest year first), `orderby="name|date"`,
  `document_order="asc|desc"` and `hide_empty="yes"`. Example:
  `[mulino_documents folder="minutes" folder_order="desc"]`

## Extending

Mulino file show fires a set of actions and filters intended for building a
separate add-on plugin on top of it (rather than modifying this plugin
directly). See [`HOOKS.md`](HOOKS.md) for the full list.

## Running the tests

The test suite uses PHPUnit + WP_Mock and runs in plain PHP — no
WordPress install or database required. See
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for setup instructions.

```bash
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
